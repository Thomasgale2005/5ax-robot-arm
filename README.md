# 5ax-robot-arm
Prototype 1:
This early early hardware model uses a very simple design, made up of a set of inline servos connected by 3d printed supports.
This robot prototype's main purpose is for use as a testbed for the robot inverse kinematics and the general robot control code.
The inverse kinematics and the general robot control code is drafted in python but manually translated into c++ for testing in an arduino.
